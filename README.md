# Accuknox Assignment

## Overview
This project contains solutions for the **Accuknox Django Assignment**:

1. **Django Signals**
   - Are signals synchronous or asynchronous?  
   - Do signals run in the same thread as the caller?  
   - Do signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?  

2. **Python Custom Class**
   - `Rectangle` class which supports iteration  
   - Iteration outputs `{'length': value}` followed by `{'width': value}`

## Django Signals Testing

http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-signal/  â†’ Proves signals run synchronously

http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-thread/  â†’ Proves signals run in the same thread

http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-transaction/  â†’ Proves signals run in the same transaction

âœ… Console logs will clearly show the proof.
